# Texture Rendering Project

This program loads a given .obj file and texture and renders the object as either a textured object or a wireframe. The user can control the camera. This project was made for the class Computational Structures in Computer Graphics (CAP4730).

> (This project was built off a previous project I wrote for this class, so this video is not comprehensive of all the changes I made to this script)

For the most significant code the I wrote see the following scripts:
- [main.cpp](source/main.cpp)
- [GridObject.cpp](source/gridObject.cpp)
- [meshObject.cpp](source/meshObject.cpp)
